# ENPM-661-Proj-3--Phase-3

Implementation of A* algorithm on a differential drive (non-holonomic) TurtleBot robot
In this project we will navigate a differential drive robot (TurtleBot 2 / TurtleBot 3) in a given map environment from a given start point to a given goal point, considering differential drive constraints while implementing the A* algorithm, with 8-connected action space .
